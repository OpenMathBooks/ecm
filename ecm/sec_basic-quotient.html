<a href="sec_basic-quotient.html" class="permalink">¬∂</a><section class="introduction" id="introduction-17"><p id="p-332">So far we have been able to solve our counting problems simply by use of the sum and product principles, together with the fact that the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set is \(\binom{n}{k}\) (the values of which can be found in Pascal's triangle). This means that we have always <em class="emphasis">built up</em> the set of outcomes by combining smaller sets of outcomes combined in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-333">It is often useful to go the other way.  We could purposely over count the number of outcomes, but in a way that we can recover the correct set.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-quotient"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.3.1</span> <span class="title">The Quotient Principle</span>
</h3>
<a href="sec_basic-quotient.html#subsec-quotient" class="permalink">¬∂</a><p id="p-334">In <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-binomformula.html" title="Exercise 29">Exercise¬†29</a>, you proved the algebraic formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\text{.}\)  However, this was done rather indirectly.  First you proved the identity \(P(n,k) = \binom{n}{k}k!\text{,}\) then wrote \(P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\text{,}\) and finally solved for \(\binom{n}{k}\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-335">This approach has the advantage of illustrating the connection between combinations and permutations, but the combinatorial argument that both sides of the identity are equal asked you to count the number of <em class="emphasis">permutations</em> in two ways.  It is instructive to think of this equation in terms of <em class="emphasis">combinations</em> instead.  Let's start with a concrete example.</p>

<div class="introduction" id="introduction-18"><p id="p-336">Let's count the number of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) of size 3.  Of course we already know the answer should be \(\binom{5}{3}\text{,}\) which we can see in Pascal's triangle is equal to 10.  What might you try if you didn't already know this?</p></div>
<article class="exercise-like" id="task-66"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p id="p-337">You might first guess that the answer is \(5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\) since there are 5 choices for which element you put in your subset first, then  4 choices for the next element, and 3 choices for the last element.  Write down all 60 of the outcomes you get by counting the ‚Äúsubsets‚Äù this way.<a data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl" data-refid="hk-fn-1" id="fn-1"><sup>‚Äâ1‚Äâ</sup></a></p>

<p id="p-339">Explain why every subset corresponds to the same number of permutations.

We had a set of permutations (all 60 of the 3-permutations of the set \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)).  Then we noticed that some of these permutations corresponded the the same subset.  Saying that these permutations were related like this feels like defining a equivalence relation.</p>

</div></article></article><p id="p-348">This suggests a general approach to solving a counting problem.  Say we want to count the number of elements in a set \(S\text{.}\)  Suppose we can count the size of some set \(T\text{,}\) perhaps containing many more elements than we are actually interested in counting.  Then define an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(T\) so that there is a bijection between \(S\) and the set of equivalence classes \(T/\sim\text{.}\)  Then if we know the size of \(T/\sim\text{,}\) we have the size of \(S\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-349">Look at the notation \(T/\sim\) that we used to denote the set of equivalence classes of \(T\) under \(\sim\text{.}\)  This set is sometimes called the <dfn class="terminology">quotient set</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">quotient space</dfn> of \(T\) by \(\sim\text{.}\)  This is a good name, as you are dividing up a set into parts.  It is also a good name because sometimes we can conclude</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
|T/\sim| = |T|/|A|
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(A\) is one of the equivalence classes under \(\sim\text{.}\)  When can you do this?</p>
<p id="p-350">Note this is exactly what we did when we counted subsets: we divided the number of permutations by the number of permutations equivalent to each other.  That worked precisely because <em class="emphasis">all the equivalence classes had the same size</em>!</p>
<p id="p-351">This justifies the <dfn class="terminology">quotient principle</dfn> we now state.</p>

Here are a few examples of how you can use it in counting.  In each of the following activities, make sure you can say exactly how the quotient principle could be used.</p>

For example, if we can get one arrangement of people around the table from another by having everyone get up and move to the right one place and sit back down, we get an equivalent arrangement of people.

<p id="p-402">List out all 3-scoop cones and form the equivalence classes of shakes to see the issue.</p></article></article><p id="p-403">The previous activity illustrates that you cannot always simply apply the quotient principle to eliminate order mattering.  What we are after in the 3-scoop shakes with possibly repeated flavors is a <dfn class="terminology">multiset</dfn>, which is just like a set only we allow for elements to be in the set multiple times, but we still do not care in what order the elements are listed.  So an example of an \(4\)-element multiset of \([7]\) is \(\{1,3,3,6\}\text{,}\) which is the same multiset as \(\{1,6,3,3\}\) but different from the multiset \(\{1,3,6\}\) (in particular, this multiset only has three elements).</p>
<p id="p-404">What we tried to do above was to count multisets by first counting sequences with possibly repeated elements, and then divide out by the number of sequences that just differ by the arrangement of a particular multiset.  But this didn't work, because the size of each block was not the same.</p>
<p id="p-405">However, we would still like to be able to count the number of multisets.  How can we do this?  Is it an application of the quotient principle after all?  To start, let's establish some notation.  The number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) was given by \(n\) choose \(k\) (written \(\binom{n}{k}\)), so we will say that the number of \(k\)-element <em class="emphasis">multisets</em> of \([n]\) will be <dfn class="terminology">\(n\) multichoose \(k\)</dfn>, and write \(\mchoose{n}{k}\text{.}\)  From what we have seen above, we can say,</p>

\begin{equation*}
\mchoose{n}{k} \ne \frac{n^k}{k!}

<p id="p-435">In how many ways may we place all the books?</p></article></article><p id="p-437">The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function does not determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an <dfn class="terminology">ordered function</dfn> from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.<a data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl" data-refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup>‚Äâ2‚Äâ</sup></a></p>

<p id="p-438">We often think of functions as a rule that assigns an output to each input.  However, we could equally well specify a function by giving the complete inverse image of each element of the codomain.

<p id="p-450">What sort of distribution problem does the previous task correspond to?  Write a question about books and shelves that has the same answer.</p></article></article><p id="p-452">AHA!  The previous activity suggests that to count multisets, which is the same as counting distributions of identical objects to distinct recipients, we should apply the quotient principle to ordered functions.</p>
<p id="p-453">What should the equivalence relation be?  Think about bookshelves.  An ordered function is a distribution of distinct books to distinct shelves.  A multiset is a distribution of identical books to distinct shelves.  So we want two ordered functions to be equivalent if their corresponding shelves contain the same number of books (we no longer care what those books are, just how many there are).</p>
<p id="p-454">Now, given any ordered function, how many ordered functions are in its equivalence class?  We can get any other element in the class by permuting the books (but keeping the numbers in each shelf constant).  There are \(k\) books, so there are \(k!\) ways to permute them.  This is the same for <em class="emphasis">every</em> ordered function, so the equivalence classes all have the same size.</p>
<p id="p-455">Applying the quotient principle, we arrive at the following.</p>

Or perhaps thinking about each multiset as a \((n-1+k)\)-bit string of weight \(k\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-458">There is a standard interpretation for this.  We call this approach <dfn class="terminology">stars and bars</dfn> (others use <em class="emphasis">balls and wall</em> or <em class="emphasis">dashes and slashes</em>; the important thing is that it rhymes).  The idea is that we represent each multiset as a string of \(k\) ‚Äústars‚Äù and \(n-1\) ‚Äúbars‚Äù.  These are really just bit strings in disguise, so the binomial coefficient becomes clear.
