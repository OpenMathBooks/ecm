<p>As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> some. By a <dfn class="terminology">picture</dfn> of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture \(P(s)\) to each member \(s\) of a set \(S\) will be called a <dfn class="terminology">picture function</dfn> . The <dfn class="terminology">picture enumerator</dfn> for a picture function \(P\) defined on a set \(S\) will be</p>
