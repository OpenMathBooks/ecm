<p>If this is the case, what could we conclude?  Every time we add an edge, either the number of vertices or the number of faces increases by 1.  Perhaps then \(e = v + f\text{?}\)  But this is not true, since for \(P_1\) we would have \(1 = 2 + 1\text{,}\) clearly false.  Okay, at least we might guess \(v + f - e\) is constant.  And from \(P_1\text{,}\) we see that constant would need to be \(2 + 1 - 1 = 2\text{.}\)  This leads us to conjecture the following theorem.</p>
