<p>The total number of sequences of \(n\) H's and \(n\) D's is \(\binom{2n}{n}\text{.}\) We delete the number of <em class="emphasis">nonworkable</em> sequences. Each such sequence has a first snag as shown by the highlighted D in</p>

\begin{equation*}
\text{H\ H\ D\ D\ \alert{D}\ H\ H\ D\ D\ D\ H\ H}

<p>a sequence of \(n+1\) H's and \(n-1\) D's. For \(n = 3\) , H D \alert{D} D H H is a non-workable sequence with the snag indicated. Its mate, found by reversing the first three letters, is D H H D H H, a sequence of 2D's and 4H's. <em class="emphasis">Any</em> arrangement of 2D's and 4H's will correspond to exactly one non-workable sequence; simply scan through and see the <em class="emphasis">first</em> time the H's dominate the D's and then reverse through that spot. There are \(\binom{6}{3}
= 20\) arrangements of 3H's and 3D's. There are \(\binom{6}{2}
= 15\) arrangements of 2D's and 4H's each of which corresponds to a non-workable sequence. Hence there are \(\binom{6}{3}
-\binom{6}{2} = 5\) workable sequences. In general, \(\binom{2n}{n}  - \binom{2n}{n - 1} = \frac{1}{n + 1}\binom{2n}{n}\) gives the number of workable sequences.</p>
