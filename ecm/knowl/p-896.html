<p>Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of \(y+1\) for \(x\) in the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i\text{,}\) because in order to interpret \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i\) as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the \((y+1)^i\) terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of \(y^0\text{,}\) and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of anyÂ \(y^i\text{.}\) (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute \(y+y^2\) for \(x\text{.}\) Can you see why?)</p>
