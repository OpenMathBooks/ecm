<p>Note first that any graph with one vertex can be properly 6-colored (the base case).  Now let \(G\) be an arbitrary graph with \(n\) vertices, and assume that any graph with fewer than \(n\) vertices can be properly 6-colored.  Let \(v\) be a vertex of \(G\) of degree 5 or less.</p>
<p>Consider the graph \(G' = G - v\) (the graph resulting from removing \(v\) and all its incident edges from \(G\)).  Since \(G'\) has \(n-1\) vertices, it is possible to properly 6-color its vertices.  Looking back at \(G\text{,}\) we see that \(v\) is only adjacent to at most 5 vertices, so there are at most 5 colors we cannot use to color \(v\text{.}\)  But we have 6 colors to work with, so we will be able to color \(v\text{,}\) and thus all of \(G\text{,}\) properly.</p>
