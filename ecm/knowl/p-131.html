<p>How are <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-pascalsym-dc.html" title="Activity 12">Activity 12</a> and <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-pascalsym-bij.html" title="Activity 13">Activity 13</a> different?  The first consists of answering a single counting question in two different ways, and those ways are the two sides of the identity.  Such proofs are sometimes called <em class="emphasis">double counting proofs</em>, or sometimes just <em class="emphasis">combinatorial proofs</em>.  On the other hand, <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-pascalsym-bij.html" title="Activity 13">Activity 13</a> proceeds by showing two different sets have the same size, using a bijection, and shows that these two sets are counted by each side of the identity.  These proofs are called <em class="emphasis">bijective proofs</em> (and are also sometimes grouped together with double counting proofs as combinatorial proofs).</p>
