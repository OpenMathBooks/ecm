<p>To prove this is a bijection, there are four things we need to check:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>That \(f(x)\) is defined for each \(x \in X\) (i.e., every lattice path is sent to some \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\)).</li>
<li>That \(f(x)\) is <em class="emphasis">uniquely</em> defined for each \(x \in X\) (i.e., no lattice path is sent to more than one bit string).</li>
<li>That every \(y \in Y\) is the image of at least one \(x \in X\) (i.e., that every \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\) is the output of the function at least once).</li>
<li>That every \(y \in Y\) is the image of at most one \(x \in X\) (i.e., that no \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\) is the output of the function more than once.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two conditions guarantee that \(f\) will be a function.  The third says that \(f\) is onto (a surjection).  The fourth says that \(f\) is one-to-one (an injection).</p>
