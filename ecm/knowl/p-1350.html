<p>We start by giving a function from the set of partitions of \(k\) to the set of partitions of \(k\) with (only) odd parts. Clearly such a function cannot be one to one. Then we show that when restricted to the partitions with distinct parts it is one-to-one and onto by constructing an inverse. Given a partition \(\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\text{,}\) write \(\lambda_i=\gamma_i2^{k_i}\text{,}\) where \(\gamma_i\) is odd. (Thus \(2^{k_i}\) is the highest power of 2 that is a factor of \(\lambda_i\text{,}\) so it is 1 if \(\lambda_i\) is odd.). It is possible that \(\gamma_i=\gamma_j\text{,}\) for example if \(\lambda_i=36\) and \(\lambda_j=18\text{,}\) then \(\gamma_i=\gamma_j=9\text{.}\) We construct a new partition \(\pi\) whose parts are the numbers \(\gamma_j\) as follows: Given an odd number \(p\text{,}\) let the multiplicity \(m(p)\) of \(p\) in \(\pi\) be \(\sum_{j: \gamma_j=m} 2^{k_j}\text{.}\) Thus \(\sum_{p: m(p)\not=0}m(p)p = k\text{.}\) Therefore, \(\pi\) is a partition of \(k\) whose parts are all odd.</p>
