<p>Suppose you have a group of \(n\) people and you wish to form a subcommittee of \(k\) people with one of those \(k\) people to serve as chair. Choose the subcommittee in \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways and the chair in \(k\) ways. The product rule gives \(k \binom{n}{k}\) as the number of ways of selecting such a chaired subcommittee.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could first choose any one of the \(n\) people to serve as chair and then fill out the committee in \(\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\) ways. There are \(n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\) ways to select a chaired subcommittee. Hence \(k \binom{n}{k} = n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\text{.}\)</p>
