<body><div class="solution"><p>Suppose we list the people in the club in some way, and keep that list for the remainder of the problem. Take the first person from the list and pair that person with any of the \(2n-1\) remaining people. Now take the next <em class="emphasis">unpaired</em> person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining \(2n-3\) unpaired people. Continuing in this way, once \(k\) pairs have been selected, take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining \(2n-2k-1\) unpaired people. Every pairing can arise in this way, and no pairing can arise twice in this process. Thus the number of outcomes is \(\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} 2n-2i-1\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
