<p>First, we acknowledge that not everyone reading this book will be immediately familiar with the content of a standard undergraduate discrete mathematics course.  Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof.  For the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions), background material is included in an Appendix.</p>
