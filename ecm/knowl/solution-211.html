<p>Recall that in order for \(f\) to define an isomorphism between \(G1\) and \(G2\text{,}\) it must preserve relationships between vertices. To put this into context, this means that since \(a\) and \(b\) are joined via an edge in \(G1\) that their corresponding vertices in \(G2\) must also be joined by an edge. This must be true for all of the vertices and edges. When examining the function, we can see that the vertex \(g\) goes to \(v_7\text{,}\) that is \(f(g)=v_7\text{.}\) BUT, \(g\) has exactly 2 edges (so \(g\) is degree 2) and \(v_7\) is degree 3. This means that \(f\) cannot possibly be an isomorphism. Similarly, we can see that \(f\) does not take \(c\) to the correct vertex either \(c\) is degree 2 and \(v_1\) has degree 3.</p>
