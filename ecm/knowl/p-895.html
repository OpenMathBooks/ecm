<p>Generating functions for infinite sequences are examples of power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.</p>
