<p>We must decide on a child for each piece of fruit.  There are \(n\) choices for the first piece of fruit, \(n\) choices for the second, and so on.  The product principle says that there will be \(n^k\) ways to distribute the fruit.</p>
<p>Slightly more mathematically speaking, we are counting the number of functions from a set of cardinality \(k\) (the fuits) to a set of cardinality \(n\) (the children).  Note that it does not make sense to think of the ways we can send the children to the fruit, since we do not require that every child gets a fruit, and we insist that all fruit is distributed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_basic-proofs.html#li-27">in-context</a></span>
