<p>We know that the Catalan numbers count the number of rooted binary trees.  Specifically, the number of rooted binary trees with \(n+2\) leaves is \(C_{n+1}\text{.}\)  Thus we must simply argue that the number of rooted binary trees with \(n+2\) leaves is also</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^{n} C_iC_{n-i} = C_0C_{n} + C_1C_{n-1} + \cdots + C_{n}C_0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To see this, consider the result of removing the root of a rooted binary tree.  This results in two more trees (the left and right child of the root are the new roots).  These will either be rooted binary trees, or a single vertex (in the case that one of the children of the root was a leaf already).  There are \(n+1\) cases: the left tree is just the root (so the right tree has \(n+1\) leaves), the left tree has 2 leaves (so the right tree has \(n\) leaves), the left tree has 3 leaves (so the right tree has \(n-1\) leaves), and so on until the case where the left tree has \(n+1\) leaves (and the right tree is just the root).</p>
<p>Each of these cases corresponds to a term in the sum.  When the left tree has \(i+1\) leaves, it could be any of \(C_{i}\) trees, and for each, the right tree could be any of \(C_{n-i}\) trees (they all have \(n+2-(i+1) = n-i+1\) leaves).  Using the product and then sum prinicple, we get the right hand side of the recurrence.</p>
