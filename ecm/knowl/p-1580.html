<p>Suppose a graph has an Euler circuit, written \((v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)\text{.}\)  Since it is a circuit, we have \(v_0 = v_n\text{.}\)  Consider the edges used in this path.  They are \(\{v_0, v_1\}\text{,}\) \(\{v_1, v_2\}\text{,}\) and so on up to \(\{v_{n-1}, v_n\}\text{.}\)  Every time a vertex appears in the walk, it is part of two edges, except for \(v_0\) and \(v_n\text{.}\)  But these are the same vertex, so taken together, these constitute two edges as well.  Since every edges is used in an Euler circuit, we see that every vertex must have even degree.</p>
