<p>If you want to prove that two sets have the same number of elements, all that is required is to define a function from one set to the other, and prove that the function is a bijection.  For us, those two sets will be the set of outcomes we are counting.  So for example, we can show that the <em class="emphasis">set</em> of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) has the same cardinality as the <em class="emphasis">set</em> of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\text{.}\)  This will prove that the counting questions, “how many \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) are there?” and, “how many \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) are there?” have the same answer.</p>
