<p>We would like to understand why the patterns you discovered above exist, and to prove that they really do exist everywhere in the triangle.  There are at least two ways we can proceed (and we will try to proceed in both ways to maximize our understanding).  First, we can use notation to describe the entries in the triangle, provide a definition for what each entry is, and prove our results entirely based on these definitions.  Second, we can ascribe some <em class="emphasis">meaning</em> to the entries in the triangle, saying what the numbers represent, and then make arguments about those representations.</p>
