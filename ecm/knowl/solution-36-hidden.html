<p>Choose people in ordered pairs.  The first person in an ordered pair serves first.  There are \(2n(2n-1)\) ways to choose one pair, \((2n-2)(2n-3)\) ways to choose a second pair, and once \(k\) pairs have been chosen, there are \((2n-2k)(2n-2k-1)\) ways to choose the next pair.  The number of <em class="emphasis">lists</em> of pairs we get in this way is \(\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (2n-2i)(2n-2i-1) = (2n)!\text{.}\) However, each way of pairing people gets listed \(n!\) times since we see all possible length \(n\) lists of pairs.  Therefore the number of actual pairings is \(\frac{(2n)!}{n!} = (2n)^{\underline{n}}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For yet another solution, we can list the \(2n\) members in \((2n)!\) ways. Then we can take the first two as a tennis pair, with the first person serving first, the next two, and so on. There are \(n!\) ways that a given set of tennis pairings could be arranged, so the tennis pairings partition the set of all permutations of the \(2n\) members into blocks of size \(n!\text{.}\) Thus we have \(\frac{(2n)!}{n!}\) tennis pairings once again.</p>
