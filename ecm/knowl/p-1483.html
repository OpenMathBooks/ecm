<p>This was found by first noting that \(b\) in \(V_1\) is the only vertex of degree 5, and in \(V_2\) it is \(v_5\) that has that honor.  So if there were to be any isomorphism, we would need \(g(b) = v_5\text{.}\)  Then in \(V_1\text{,}\) only \(g\) is not adjacent to \(b\text{,}\) so we must have \(g(g) = v_7\text{.}\)  We can then look at the other vertex adjacent to \(g\text{,}\) which is \(f\) and conclude \(g(f) = v_3\text{.}\)  And so on.</p>
