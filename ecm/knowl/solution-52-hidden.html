<body><div class="solution"><p>In <a data-knowl="./knowl/bookcaseeveryshelf.html" title="Activity 62">problemÂ 62</a> we showed that with \(k\) distinct books we could place the books in \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) ways. We can partition these arrangements of distinct books into blocks, where each block consists of all arrangements that we get just by permuting the books among themselves. Thus each block has \(k!\) arrangements in it, and each arrangement corresponds to an arrangement of identical books. Thus there are \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) ways to arrange identical books.</p></div></body>
