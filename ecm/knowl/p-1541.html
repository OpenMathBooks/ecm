<p>Note: some sources give slightly different definitions for these concepts.  For example, sometimes a walk is defined as a alternating sequence of vertices and edges \(v_1e_1v_2e_2v_3\cdots e_{n-1}v_n\) with the requirement that \(v_i\) is incident to \(e_i\text{,}\) which is incident to \(v_{i+1}\text{.}\)  We have not named our edges, so this definition would not make sense.  Another common way to define <em class="emphasis">path</em> is as a subgraph isomorphic to \(P_n\) for some \(n\text{.}\)  This is almost equivalent to our definition, except that we allow our paths to possibly be isomorphic to \(C_n\) for some \(n\) as well.  Some sources use <em class="emphasis">path</em> where we use <em class="emphasis">walk</em> and use <em class="emphasis">simple path</em> where we use <em class="emphasis">path</em>.</p>
