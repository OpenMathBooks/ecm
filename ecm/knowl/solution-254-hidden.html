<body><div class="solution"><p>Take a person, say person 1. If person has six acquaintances, then by <a data-knowl="./knowl/act_R-3-3.html" title="Activity 316">ActivityÂ 316</a> among them there are either three mutual strangers, in which case we are done, or three mutual acquaintances. These three acquaintances together with person 1 form a set of 4 mutual acquaintances in which case we are again done. Thus we may assume Person 1 has at most 5 acquaintances, and so has four non-acquaintances. Now either all four of these people are acquainted, in which case we are done, or else two of them are not acquainted. Then these two people, together with person 1 make three mutual non-acquaintances. Therefore in every possible case, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. This means that \(R(4,3) \le 10\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
