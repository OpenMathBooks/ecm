<p>If we want to understand the relationship between the number of vertices, edges and faces of a planar graph, we could first try to decide which triples can be realized by a graph and which cannot.  At first this might seem like a daunting task.  The key is to think of it recursively.  Perhaps start with simple graphs and build up to more complicated ones.</p>
