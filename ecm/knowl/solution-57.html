<p>Start by enumerating the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 0}\text{.}\)  There is only 1 subset of the empty set (so \(a_0 = 1\)).  There are two subsets of \([1]\text{,}\) and four subsets of \([2]\text{.}\)  So the sequence looks like \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots\text{.}\)  It <em class="emphasis">appears</em> that the recurrence relation should be \(a_n = 2a_{n-1}\) with initial condition \(a_0 = 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>To prove this is correct, we <em class="emphasis">must</em> reference the things we are counting (saying that the recurrence agrees with the finitely many terms we have listed is NOT enough).  Consider the \(a_{n-1}\) different subsets of \([n-1]\text{.}\)  Each of these is a subset of \([n]\text{,}\) in particular, a subset of \([n]\) that does not include the number \(n\) as an element.  Further, to each of these sets, we can add the element \(n\) to get another distinct subset of \([n]\text{.}\)  So far, we have found \(2a_{n-1}\) subsets of \([n]\text{.}\)  Actually, we have found all of them: every subset of \([n]\) either includes \(n\) or it does not.</p>
