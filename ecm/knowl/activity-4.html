<div class="introduction">
<p>Some definitions: A <dfn class="terminology">bit</dfn> is either 0 or 1 (bit is short for “binary digit”).  Thus a <dfn class="terminology">bit string</dfn> is a string of bits.  The <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of a bit string is the number of bits in the string; the <dfn class="terminology">weight</dfn> of a bit string is the number of 1's in the string (or equivalently, the sum of the bits). A <dfn class="terminology">\(n\)-bit string</dfn> means a bit string of length \(n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We will write \(\B^n_k\) to mean the set of all \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\text{.}\)  So for example, some of the elements in \(\B^5_3\) are,</p>

<article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Write out all \(3\)-bit strings.  Group these by weight.  How many strings are there of each weight?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Write out all \(4\)-bit strings.  You might want to use the list you had in the previous part as a starting point (how would you do this?).  Again, group these strings by weight and see how many there are of each type.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>How many \(5\)-bit strings of weight 3 are there?  List all of these, and say how they relate to some of the \(4\)-bit strings you found above.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_counting-binom.html#activity-4">in-context</a></span>
