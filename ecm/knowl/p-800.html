<p>Now if \(S\) is nonempty, and has \(s\) members, we seat one of the couples that must sit together (say the first in alphabetical order), and this determines the sex of the person that must sit at each other place. There are \(2n\) pairs of adjacent seats where we can seat that couple and two ways they can sit in the pair of adjacent seats that we choose. Then we have \(s-1\) couples, \(n-s\) men and \(n-s\) women to seat in the remaining places. First we arrange the \(s-1\) couples and \(2n-2s\) identical empty chairs in places at the table in \((2n-2s+s-1)!/(2n-2s)!=(2n-s-1)!/(2n-2s)!\) ways. Each couple can sit in only one way in the places they have chosen, because the sex of the person in a given place has been determined by how the first couple sits. The sex of the person in each of the remaining chairs has been determined, so we assign the men to their seats in \((n-s)!\) ways and we assign the women to their seats in \((n-s)!\) ways. Thus we have \(2\cdot2n(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2/(2n-2s)!\) ways to place the people. But we can partition the placements into blocks of \(2n\) equivalent placements, because shifting everyone the same number of places to the right or left gives an equivalent placement. Thus the number of inequivalent seating arrangements is</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{2(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2}{(2n-2s)!} =\amp \frac{2(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2}{2(n-s)(2n-2s-1)!}\\
=\amp \frac{(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!(n-s-1)!}{(2n-2s-1)!}.
