<p>The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\text{.}\) Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is \(m\) or more units wide (horizontally) and \(n\) or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an \(m'\) unit wide and \(n'\) unit deep rectangle with \(m'\ge m\) and \(n' \ge n\text{,}\) as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/complementpartition.html" title="Figure 2.4.8">FigureÂ 2.4.8</a>.</p>
