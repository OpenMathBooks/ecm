<body><div class="solution"><p>Conjugation is a bijection between partitions with largest part at most \(m\) and partitions with at most \(m\) parts. Thus the coefficient of \(x^i\) (the number of partitions of \(i\) into parts of size at most \(m\)) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most \(m\) will be the coefficient of \(x^i\) (the number of partitions of \(i\) with at most \(m\) parts) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most \(m\text{.}\) Thus the two generating functions are the same.</p></div></body>
