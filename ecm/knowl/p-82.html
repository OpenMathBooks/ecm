<p>What about choice 5?  This is new, although not really, as it captures all of the previous four: Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 bits to be 1's.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such bit strings.</p></li>
<li><p>How many subsets of \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) contain exactly 3 elements?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 elements to be in our subset.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such subsets.</p></li>
<li><p>How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such lattice paths.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\text{?}\)  We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an \(x\text{.}\)  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so the coefficient is \({5 \choose 3}\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
