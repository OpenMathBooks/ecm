<p>The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled twin beds is \(B_{2} = 2\) ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is \(B_{3} = 5\) ways: each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty subsets.</p>
