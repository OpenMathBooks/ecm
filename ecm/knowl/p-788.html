<p>The principle of inclusion and exclusion generally refers to both this formula and the one for the union.  Both formulas are notationally horrific, but the idea is straight forward.  To find the size of the union, we add the sizes of each set individually, then subtract each of the sizes of the intersections of pairs of sets, then add back in the sizes of the intersections of triples of sets, subtract 4-tuple intersections, add 5-tuple intersections, and so on until we are done.  The compliment can be calculated by subtracting the union from the size of the original set.</p>
