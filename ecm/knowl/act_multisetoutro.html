<div class="introduction"><p>In <a data-knowl="./knowl/act_multisetintro.html" title="Activity 53">Activity 53</a> and <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-distributionintro.html" title="Activity 54">Activity 54</a> you considered some counting questions we claimed could be expressed as multisets.  Now solve each of these using stars and bars and the formula in <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-multisetsize.html" title="Theorem 1.3.4">Theorem 1.3.4</a>.  Be sure to clearly state which part of the problem corresponds to the stars and which to the bars, and why this makes sense.</p></div>
