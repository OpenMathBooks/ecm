<p>This book is a synthesis of three textbooks on discrete mathematics and combinatorics.  First, many of the problems, and indeed entire sections, come directly from <span class="booktitle">Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery</span> by Kenneth P. Bogart.  This is possible thanks to the Bogart estate's decision to release his book under an open license (the GFDL, the same license this text uses).  The format of this book has been made to match that of Bogart's text, with most of the exposition being driven by problems (which we call <em class="emphasis">activities</em>) for students to work on.  A copy of Bogart's book can be found for free at <a class="external" href="http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/" target="_blank">bogart.openmathbooks.org</a>.</p>
