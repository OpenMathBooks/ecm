<p>Walks and paths are useful for considering all sorts of graph theoretic concepts.  For example, you might want to find the <dfn class="terminology">distance</dfn> between two vertices.  This would be defined as the shortest path starting at one and ending at the other (where the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of a path is the number of edges in it).  If you have a notion of distance, you can define the <em class="emphasis">center</em> and <em class="emphasis">radius</em> of a graph.  Graphs are <em class="emphasis">connected</em> provided between any two vertices, there is a path (or equivalently, a walk).</p>
