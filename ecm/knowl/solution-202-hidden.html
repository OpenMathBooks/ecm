<p>Thinking about the Young diagrams for partitions of \(k\) into exactly \(m\) distinct parts, each will have at least 1 sqaure in row \(m\text{,}\) at least 2 squares in row \(m-1\text{,}\) etc, and at least \(m\) squares in row 1.  If we remove these \(1 + 2 +\cdots + m = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}\) squares, we get a diagram for a partition of \(k-\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\) into at most \(m\) parts.  Further, if we started with a partition of \(k-\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\) into at most \(m\) parts, we can transform it into a partition for \(k\) into exactly \(m\) distinct parts by adding the triangle of \(\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\) squares.</p>
<p>Let \(f(x)\) be the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into exactly \(m\) distinct parts.  That is, in \(f(x)\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(x^k\) is the number of partitions of \(k\) into exactly \(m\) distinct parts.  Then \(f(x)/x^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}\) is the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into at most \(m\) parts.  But that is \(\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots(1-x^m)}\text{.}\)</p>
