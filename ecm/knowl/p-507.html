<p>We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in <a data-knowl="./knowl/brokenpermutation.html" title="Exercise 66">Exercise 66</a>. Instead of dividing a set up into non-overlapping parts, we may think of dividing a <em class="emphasis">permutation</em> (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a <dfn class="terminology">broken permutation</dfn>   of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\text{.}\) The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a <dfn class="terminology">Lah Number</dfn> and, from our solution to <a data-knowl="./knowl/brokenpermutation.html" title="Exercise 66">Exercise 66</a>, is equal to \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\text{.}\)</p>
