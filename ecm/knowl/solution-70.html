<p>Represent each lattice path as a string of R's and U's.  Represent each way that the movie patrons can line up as a string of H's and D's.  The bijection will send each R to an H and each U to a D.</p>
<p>We need to verify that this bijection is both well defined, and that its inverse is well defined (that the function is injective and surjective).  The key to all of these is to consider what makes a string valid in each case.</p>
<p>First, notice that the lattice paths must have an equal number of R's and U's.  Similarly, the string of movie patrons must have an equal number of H's and D's. Further, every initial substring of R's and U's must have at least as many R's as U's, so that the path does not go above the line \(y=x\text{.}\)  Similarly, the every initial substring of H's and D's (half dollars and dollars) must have at least as many H's as D's, so that change can always be given.  The H's and R's must <em class="emphasis">dominate</em>.</p>
<p>The the conditions on what makes a string valid match up, so every string in one set will match up with exactly one string in the other.</p>
