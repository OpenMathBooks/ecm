<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Suppose this were not the case. Then there would be a graph with \(v\) vertices, each with degree 6 or more. At a minimum then, there would be \(6v/2 = 3v\) edges, so \(e \ge 3v\text{.}\) By the previous exercise, we also have that \(e \le 3v - 6\text{.}\) But these two facts are contradictory. Thus any planar graph must have a vertex of degree 5 or less.</p></article></body>
