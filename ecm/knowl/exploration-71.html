<div class="introduction"><p>Here is a way to establish the closed formula for \(C_n\) using Dyck words.  For simplicity, consider Dyck words using the symbols 0 and 1, insisting that no initial segment contains more 1's than 0's.</p></div>
<article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Of all \(2n\)-bit strings of weight \(n\text{,}\) some are Dyck words and some are not.  Explain which are not.  What do all of these have in common?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Suppose some initial segment of a bit string contains one more 1 than 0.  If you changed every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1 in this initial segment, how many 0's and how many 1's would the entire bit string have?</p>
<p>The resulting string will have one more 0 and one fewer 1.  That is, if the weight was originally \(n\text{,}\) the weight would now be \(n-1\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>Describe a bijection between the set of \(2n\)-bit strings of weight \(n-1\) and the set of \(2n\)-bit strings of weight \(n\) that are NOT Dyck words.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>Why does this prove that \(C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1}\text{?}\)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_basic-catalan.html#exploration-71">in-context</a></span>
