<p>The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function does not determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an <dfn class="terminology">ordered function</dfn> from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.<a data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>
