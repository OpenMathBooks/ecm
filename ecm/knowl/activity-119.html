<div class="introduction"><p>Suppose we have already proved <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulercircuit.html" title="Theorem 3.2.3">Theorem 3.2.3</a>, that a graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.  Suppose now we want to prove <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulerpath.html" title="Theorem 3.2.4">Theorem 3.2.4</a>, that a graph has an Euler path if and only if it has at most two odd degree vertices.</p></div>

<p>Given a graph with an Euler path, how can you get a graph that definitely has an Euler circuit?  How did this affect the number of odd degree vertices?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a data-knowl="./knowl/hint-178-hidden.html" title="Hint 283.a.1"><span class="type">Hint</span></a></div></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Given a graph with at most two odd degree vertices, build a graph that has only even degree vertices.  If you have an Euler circuit of your new graph, what would that Euler circuit become if you looked at your original graph?</p>
<div class="solutions"><a data-knowl="./knowl/hint-179-hidden.html" title="Hint 283.b.1"><span class="type">Hint</span></a></div></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>What do each of the above tasks demonstrate?  That is, write a proof of <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulerpath.html" title="Theorem 3.2.4">Theorem 3.2.4</a> assuming <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulercircuit.html" title="Theorem 3.2.3">Theorem 3.2.3</a>.  Make sure you specify how each “direction” (implication and converse) of the proof is established by the tasks above.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_paths.html#activity-119">in-context</a></span>
