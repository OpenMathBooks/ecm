<p>If we were to expand the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
(\ap+\ap^2+\ap^3)(\pe+\pe^2)(\ba+\ba^2).\tag{2.4}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>we would get <a data-knowl="./knowl/uptothreefruits.html" title="Equation 2.3">Formula (2.3)</a>. Thus <a data-knowl="./knowl/uptothreefruits.html" title="Equation 2.3">Formula (2.3)</a> and <a data-knowl="./knowl/threefruitsagain.html" title="Equation 2.4">Formula (2.4)</a> each describe the number of multisets we can choose from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\) in which \(\apple\) appears between 1 and three times and \(\pear\) and \(\banana\) each appear once or twice. We interpret <a data-knowl="./knowl/uptothreefruits.html" title="Equation 2.3">Formula (2.3)</a> as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret <a data-knowl="./knowl/threefruitsagain.html" title="Equation 2.4">Formula (2.4)</a> as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.</p>
