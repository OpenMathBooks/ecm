<p>If \(P(n,k)\) counts the number of ways to distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) distinct recipients in which each recipient receives at most one object (do you see why this is?), then what distribution does \(\binom{n}{k}\) count?  Explain what is playing the role of “order mattering” in a distribution problem.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>We claim that counting the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical books to \(n\) distinct shelves is counted by \(\mchoose{n}{k}\text{,}\) and this is a situation in which order does not matter (since we are counting multisets).  What would the distribution question be if order did matter?  Explain why the answer to that question is NOT \(n^k\text{.}\) (What distribution does <em class="emphasis">that</em> expression count?)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_basic-quotient.html#activity-29">in-context</a></span>
