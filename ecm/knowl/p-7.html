<p>Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers.  We have put an emphasis on understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way.  Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum, most of the questions here are at a higher level.  Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by our questions have applications to secondary mathematics.  This emphasis is quite different than other mid level discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research mathematics.</p>
