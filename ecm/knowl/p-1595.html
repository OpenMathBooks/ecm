<p>Suppose the graph did have a Hamilton cycle, say \((a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, a_k, b_k, a_1)\text{.}\)  Here we are writing vertices as \(a_i\) if they are in the \(A\) part of the bipartite graph, and \(b_i\) if they are in the \(B\) part.  Since there are no edges between vertices in the same part, we know that the cycle must alternate between \(A\) vertices and \(B\) vertices, before finally returning to the starting \(A\) vertex \(a_1\text{.}\)  In particular, this says that there must be an equal number of vertices in the \(A\) and \(B\) parts.  But the graph in question does not have this.</p>
