<p>The previous activity illustrates that you cannot always simply apply the quotient principle to eliminate order mattering.  What we are after in the 3-scoop shakes with possibly repeated flavors is a <dfn class="terminology">multiset</dfn>, which is just like a set only we allow for elements to be in the set multiple times, but we still do not care in what order the elements are listed.  So an example of an \(4\)-element multiset of \([7]\) is \(\{1,3,3,6\}\text{,}\) which is the same multiset as \(\{1,6,3,3\}\) but different from the multiset \(\{1,3,6\}\) (in particular, this multiset only has three elements).</p>
