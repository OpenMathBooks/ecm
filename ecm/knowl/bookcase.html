<div class="introduction"><p>Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of the first book, the second book and so on.</p></div>

<p>Once we have \(i-1\) books placed, if we want to place book \(i\)  on a shelf that already has some books, is sliding it in to the left of all the books already there different from placing it to the right of all the books already or between two books already there?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h6>
<p>In how many ways may we place the \(i\)th book into the bookcase?</p>
