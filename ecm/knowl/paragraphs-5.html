<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Counting surjective functions.</span></h5>
<p>There are six surjective functions  \(f:[3]\to [2]\text{,}\) which happens to be \(2^3 - 2\text{.}\)  This makes sense because there are eight functions all together, but two are not surjective (do you see why?).</p>
<p>Consider functions \(f:[3]\to [3]\text{.}\)  Since each element of the domain has three potential images, there are \(3^3\) such functions.  If we only count the injective (one-to-one) functions, we will find \(3! = 6\text{.}\)  Since the size of the domain and codomain are equal, this is also the number of surjective functions (since every injective function is surjective in this case).</p>
<p>However, when the size of the codomain is larger than the size of the domain, there will be no injections and plenty of surjections.  To see how to count surjections in general, let's explore the case above where we know the answer already.</p>

<div class="introduction">Write out all 27 functions \(f:[3] \to [3]\text{.}\)  You could use two-line notation here, but to save space, perhaps just write the bottom line.  So the function that sends 1 to 1, 2 to 3 and 3 to 3 can be represented as (1,3,3).</div>

<p>There are various ways that a function might fail to be surjective.  One way is for 1 to not be in the range.  How many functions are there like this (identify them)?  Does this number make sense?  Check this is the same number of functions that do not include 2 in the range.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>How many functions do not have 1 or 2 in the range?  Does this number make sense as well?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>Explain what all this has to do with the expression</p>

<p>Given a function \(f\) from the \(k\)-element set \(K\) to the \(n\)-element set \([n]\text{,}\) we say \(f\) is in the set \(A_i\) if \(f(x)\not= i\) for any \(x\) in \(K\text{.}\)</p>
<p>How many of these sets does a surjective function belong to?</p>
