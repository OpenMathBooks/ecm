<p>Before investigating properties of sequences given by recurrence relations, we must be able to find those sequences and the recurrence relations.  The following activities give some practice with moving from a counting question to a recurrence relation for the sequence of answers.  You might be able to answer the counting questions with what we have already discovered, but do not do this.  The point of these is to start thinking about these counting problems recursively.</p>
