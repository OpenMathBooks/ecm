<p>A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a <dfn class="terminology">partition</dfn> of \(n\text{.}\) Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by the <dfn class="terminology">partition number</dfn> \(p(k)\text{;}\) in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(p(3) = 3\text{.}\) It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) to stand for partitions; we might write \(\lambda = 1,1,1\text{,}\) \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\text{,}\) and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for “\(\lambda\) is a partition of three.”</p>
