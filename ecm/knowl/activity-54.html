<p>In <a data-knowl="./knowl/fertilizer2.html" title="Activity 132">ActivityÂ 132</a>, there were just two fertilizers used to treat the sample plants. Now suppose there are three fertilizer treatments, and 15 plants are treated with nitrates, 16 with potash, 16 with phosphate, 7 with nitrate and potash, 9 with nitrate and phosphate, 8 with potash and phosphate and 4 with all three. Now how many plants have been treated? If 32 plants were studied, how many received no treatment at all?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_adv-pie.html#activity-54">in-context</a></span>
