<p>Treat each space separated by exclamation marks as a shelf.  So there is a shelf to the left of the first exclamation mark, a shelf between the first and the second, and so on, including a shelf after the last exclamation mark.</p>
<p>Physically, you could think of shelving books as first lining up all the books with bookmarks between groups of books.  You then put everything before the first separator on the first shelf, everything between the first and second separator on the second shelf, and so on.</p>
