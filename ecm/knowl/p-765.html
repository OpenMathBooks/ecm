\begin{equation*}
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{S:S\subseteq [n],
S\not=\emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1}|\bigcap_{i: i\in S}A_i|

<p>I chose this way of writing the formula partly because it is efficient with symbols; for example, it uses only one sum sign. But more importantly I chose it because it captures what I would want to say in words: ``You sum, over all ways of choosing an intersection of the sets \(A_i\text{,}\) the size of the intersection times a sign factor that is -1 if you are intersecting an even number of sets and 1 if you are intersecting an odd number." If I were writing my solution out in words, I would probably assume that nobody would think about the possibility of an intersection of the empty set of the \(A_i\)s, but I had to put the \(S\not=\emptyset\) in my formula because otherwise the formula would have had us consider the possibility that \(S\) was empty.</p>
