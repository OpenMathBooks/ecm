<p>To prove this is correct, we <em class="emphasis">must</em> reference the things we are counting (saying that the recurrence agrees with the finitely many terms we have listed is NOT enough).  Consider the \(a_{n-1}\) different subsets of \([n-1]\text{.}\)  Each of these is a subset of \([n]\text{,}\) in particular, a subset of \([n]\) that does not include the number \(n\) as an element.  Further, to each of these sets, we can add the element \(n\) to get another distinct subset of \([n]\text{.}\)  So far, we have found \(2a_{n-1}\) subsets of \([n]\text{.}\)  Actually, we have found all of them: every subset of \([n]\) either includes \(n\) or it does not.</p>
