<p>We have often thought of counting problems as asking about how many functions there are from a \(k\)-elements set to an \(n\)-element set.  The answer to this question is \(n^k\) for all functions and \(P(n,k)\) for injective functions.  What about surjective functions?  There is a reason we haven't asked this question yet, but now we can at least get an expression for the number of surjections in terms of Stirling numbers.</p>
