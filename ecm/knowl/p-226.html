<p>Some other examples of questions where the answer is a permutation:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>How many 5-letter “words” (i.e., strings of symbols) contain no repeated letters?  There are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, 23 for the fourth and 22 for the fifth, so there are \(26\cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 = P(26,5)\) such words.</p></li>
<li><p>How many different shuffled decks of cards are possible?  There are 52 choices for the bottom card, 51 for the next, and so on.  So the answer is \(P(52,52) = 52!\)</p></li>
<li><p>How many <em class="emphasis">injective</em> functions from \([k]\) to \([n]\) are there?  There are \(n\) choices for where 1 is sent, \(n-1\) choices for where \(2\) is sent (since the function is injective, 2 cannot be sent to the same element as 1), and so on.  So the answer is \(P(n,k)\text{.}\)</p></li>
