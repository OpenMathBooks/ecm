<p>Choose three sandwiches for bag one in \(\binom{9}{3}\) ways, three for bag two in \(\binom{6}{3}\) ways and put the remainder in bag 3.  This gives us \(\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{3}=\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}=1680\) ways.</p>
<p>The \(\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}\) suggests another solution. We can line up the sandwiches in 9! ways. We take the first three for bag one, the second three for bag two and the last three for bag 3. The order of the sandwiches in the bag does not matter though, so each there are \(3!3!3!\) listings corresponding to each way of putting sandwiches in bags, giving us \(\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}\) ways to put the sandwiches in bags.</p>
