<body><div class="solution"><p>Well, right off we know that the truncated icosahedron has \(12+20=32\) faces by counting the number of pentagons and hexagons. Now, because we know that every connected planar graph with \(V\) vertices, \(E\) edges and \(F\) faces satisfied \(V - E + F = 2\text{,}\) we only really need to find out the number of edges or the number of vertices since \(V-E=-30\text{.}\) So, let's maybe try to figure out the number of edges we have. If we think about the number of total edges when the pentagons and hexagons are not attached, we know that we have \(5\times 12+6\times 20=180\text{.}\) But each of these edges is shared with another edge, which means that we have cut the number of edges in half. So, we have \(90\) edges, which then gives us \(60\) vertices.</p></div></body>
