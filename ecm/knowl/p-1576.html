<p>Conversely, suppose \(G\) has at most two odd degree vertices.  If all vertices are even, then we are done by <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulercircuit.html" title="Theorem 3.2.3">TheoremÂ 3.2.3</a>.  There are no graphs with exactly one odd degree vertex.  So assume that \(G\) has exactly two odd degree vertices.  By part (b), we can build a graph \(G'\) that has all even degree vertices, which must therefore have an Euler circuit.  But this Euler circuit becomes an Euler path when you look back at \(G\text{,}\) as required.</p>
