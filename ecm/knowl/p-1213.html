<p>The Bell numbers can be generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a 2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues.</p>
