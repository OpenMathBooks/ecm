<p>By considering a Young diagram and its compliment, we saw that there is a one to one correspondence between partitions that have exactly \(m\) parts and partitions that have \(m\) as their largest part.</p>
<p>The generating function for the number of partitions of integers having <em class="emphasis">largest</em> part \(m\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots (1-x^m)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Thus this is also the number of partitions of integers having <em class="emphasis">at most</em> \(m\) parts. Now subtract those having at most \(m-1\) parts:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{(1-x)\cdots (1-x^m)} - \frac{1}{(1-x)\cdots (1-x^{m-1})} = \frac{x^m}{(1-x)\cdots(1-x^m)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Alternatively, instead of doing the algebra on the last step, we can use Young diagrams again.  There is a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into exactly \(m\) parts and partitions of \(k-m\) into at most \(m\) parts.  The bijection is: remove the first column!  So look at the infinite series for \(\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots (1-x^m)}\text{.}\)  The coefficient of \(x^{k-m}\) is the number of partitions of \(k-m\) into at most \(m\) parts.  So if we multiply each term by \(x^m\text{,}\) then the coefficient of \(x^{k-m+m} = x^{k}\) is the number of partitions of \(k-m\) into at most \(m\) parts.  But this is the number of partitions of \(k\) into <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> \(m\) parts, as required.</p>
