<p>Here is the second part of the description of the transformation. Suppose now that \(m\) is larger than the number \(j\) of rows of the top trapezoid in the Young diagram. Suppose also that the Young diagram has at least two trapezoids or it has one trapezoid and \(j\ge m-2\text{.}\) Take one square from each of the \(j\) rows of the top trapezoid (which is the whole diagram if there is only one trapezoid) and also add a row of \(j\) squares at the bottom of the diagram. (Since \(m&gt;j\text{,}\) this gives us a Young diagram of a partition of the same integer into distinct parts.) The parity of the number of rows has changed, and now the number of rows of the top trapezoid is at least as large as the smallest part of the partition. (Note, two previously distinct trapezoids may have joined together to form one on top.)  (Notice that if we have one trapezoid and \(j= m+1\text{,}\) then the construction yields a partition with two equal parts, which is why we made the special assumption above.) Now let \(T\) be the transformation described by the two constructions above. Its domain is all Young diagrams except those with one trapezoid and \(m\le j\le m+1\text{.}\) \(T^2\) is the identity, and so \(T\) is a bijection.  When restricted to partitions with an odd number of parts, \(T\) gives partitions with an even number of parts, so on its domain it gives a bijection between partitions with an even number of parts and partitions with an odd number of parts.</p>
