<p>Let \(v_b\) and \(v_e\) be the begining and ending vertices of the Euler path.  Now add a vertex \(v'\)to the graph and edges \(\{v_b, v'\}\) and \(\{v', v_e\}\text{.}\)  Now the Euler path can be extended through \(v'\) and back to \(v_b\text{,}\) completing an Euler circuit.</p>
<p>By <a data-knowl="./knowl/thm-eulercircuit.html" title="Theorem 3.2.3">TheoremÂ 3.2.3</a>, we know our new expanded graph will have all vertices of even degree.  But the degrees of \(v_b\) and \(v_e\) have increased by 1, so in the original graph, it must be that \(v_b\) and \(v_e\) (and only these) had odd degree.</p>
<p>Note that if \(v_b\) and \(v_e\) were not adjacent in the original graph, we could have just added an edge connecting them, but adding the new vertex works in that and the case where the vertices were already adjacent.</p>
