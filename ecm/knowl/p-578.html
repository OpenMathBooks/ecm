<p>The above observations can be generalized: a cubic sequence will have quadratic difference, a quartic sequence will have cubic differences, and so on.  This allows us to guess at the <em class="emphasis">form</em> of a closed formula for a polynomial sequence by taking successive differences.  If the “third differences” of a sequence are constant, then we would guess we could find a cubic polynomial.  Given the first 4 terms, we can fit the cubic to them by setting up a system of 4 equations and 4 unknowns.</p>
