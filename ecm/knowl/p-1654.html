<p>To be a little more precise, given a graph \(G\) and edge \(e = \{u,v\}\text{,}\) the graph \(G/e\) is formed by</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Removing vertices \(u\) and \(v\) and all their incident vertices.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new vertex \(E\) and edges from \(E\) to each vertex that was previously adjacent to \(u\) or \(v\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that \(G/e\) might be a multigraph (if \(u\) and \(v\) were both adjacent to a common vertex).  If \(G\) was already a multigraph, and had two edges connecting \(u\) and \(v\text{,}\) then \(E\) will get a loop (since only one of the edges was contracted).  We can avoid multigraphs by being careful which edge we contract along.</p>
