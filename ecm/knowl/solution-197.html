<p>\((1+P+P^2+P^3+P^4+P^5)(1+N+N^2+N^3+N^4+N^5)(1+D+D^2+D^3+D^4+D^5)
(1+Q+Q^2+Q^3+Q^4+Q^5)\text{.}\) Substituting \(x\) for \(P\text{,}\) \(x^5\) for \(N\text{,}\) \(x^{10}\) for \(D\) and \(x^{25}\) for \(Q\) gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^5x^i\sum_{i=0}^5x^{5i}\sum_{i=0}^5 x^{10i} \sum_{i=0}^5
x^{25i}=\frac{1-x^6}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1-x^{30}}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1-x^{60}}{
1-x^{10}}\cdot \frac{1-x^{150}}{1-x^{25}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Although we could write this as a polynomial times a product of four power series, doing so would not significantly increase our understanding, though it would let us make some painful computations of the number of ways to make a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted such numbers we would be better off asking a computer algebra package to expand the product of the polynomials on the left. With unlimited supplies the generating function becomes</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{10}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{25}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Again, we could write this as a product of power series, and that would allow us to painfully compute the number of ways to create a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted to know the number of ways to make up 200 cents, say, it would be more sensible to ask a computer algebra package to extract the coefficient of \(x^{200}\) in the product of the four quotients.</p>
