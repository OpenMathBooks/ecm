<p>To see this, consider the result of removing the root of a rooted binary tree.  This results in two more trees (the left and right child of the root are the new roots).  These will either be rooted binary trees, or a single vertex (in the case that one of the children of the root was a leaf already).  There are \(n+1\) cases: the left tree is just the root (so the right tree has \(n+1\) leaves), the left tree has 2 leaves (so the right tree has \(n\) leaves), the left tree has 3 leaves (so the right tree has \(n-1\) leaves), and so on until the case where the left tree has \(n+1\) leaves (and the right tree is just the root).</p>
