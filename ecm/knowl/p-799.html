<p>We are going to consider arrangements of the couples alternating sex around the table. This will be our set \(A\text{.}\) The set \(A_i\) is the set of arrangements in which couple \(i\) sits together. We are interested in the number of arrangements that are in none of these sets. Thus for each subset \(S\) of \([n]\text{,}\) we consider the number of arrangements in \(\displaystyle\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i\text{.}\) We distinguish the case that \(S\) is empty from the others. The number of arrangements with \(S\) empty is just the number of ways to seat \(2n\) couples around the table, alternating sex, but with no other restrictions. We can arrange one of the sexes in a circle in \(n-1!\) ways and then assign the members of the opposite sex to the places between them in \(n!\) ways, so \(\displaystyle \left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in \emptyset} A_i \right| = (n-1)!n!\text{.}\) (Another way to get this result is to let one person sit down. This determines the sex of the person at each place of the table, so there are \((n-1)!\) ways to assign the people of the same sex of the first person, and \(n!\) ways to assign the people of the opposite. It appears that there are \(2n\) choices for where the first person sits, but we can break the seating charts up into blocks of \(2n\) seating charts, each of which gives the same circular arrangement. Thus there are \((n-1)!n!\) inequivalent seating arrangments.)</p>
