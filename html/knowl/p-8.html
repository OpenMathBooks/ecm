<p>While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice.  As you will see, almost all of the textbook consists of <em class="emphasis">Activities</em> and <em class="emphasis">Exercises</em> that guide students to discover mathematics for themselves.  This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics.  Most of all, discovering mathematics is fun.</p>
