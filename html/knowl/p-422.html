<p>Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of the first book, the second book and so on.</p>
