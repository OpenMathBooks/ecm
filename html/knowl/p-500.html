<p>So far, we have only considered distribution problems in which the recipients are distinct.  There are plenty of situations where we would want to consider recipients identical.  For example, a problem we will take up in <a href="ch_advanced.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Advanced Combinatorics">ChapterÂ 2</a> is how many ways we can partition an integer.  For example, we could partition 5 as \(4+1\) or \(3+1+1\text{,}\) but we would not want to also count \(1+4\) or \(1+3+1\) (doing so would be creating a <em class="emphasis">composition</em>, which we have already considered).  We can think of the integer partition problem as distributing the 5 units that make up 5 into some number of identical bins.</p>
