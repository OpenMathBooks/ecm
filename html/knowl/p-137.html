<p>This is not to say that other proof techniques, especially mathematical induction, are not also helpful.  Inductive proofs demonstrate the importance of the recursive nature of combinatorics.  Even if we didn't know what Pascal's triangle told us about the real world, we would see that the identity was true entirely based on the recursive definition of its entries.</p>
