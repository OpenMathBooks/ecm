<p>The girth is 3, as there is a triangle (3-cycle) inside it.</p>
<p>The graph has 9 vertices and  15 edges, so if it were planer, Euler's formula would say there are \(2-9+15 = 8\) faces.  The inequality \(gf \le 2e\) becomes \(24 \le 30\) which is NOT a contradiction.  We thus cannot conclude anything at this point.</p>
