<p>When it comes to friendship, if we assume that it is always reciprocated, we can represent the people as vertices and connect two vertices with an edge if the people they represent are friends.  We can ask whether it is possible to have such a graph in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges or whether it is possible to “color” the vertices with just four colors so that no pair of same colored vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge).</p>
