<p>The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list \((\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)\text{,}\) we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has \(\lambda_1\) equally spaced dots in the first row, \(\lambda_2\) equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge. See <a data-knowl="./knowl/FerrersYoung.html" title="Figure 2.4.4">FigureÂ 2.4.4</a> for examples. The figure we draw with dots is called the <dfn class="terminology">Ferrers diagram</dfn> of the partition; sometimes the figure with squares is also called a Ferrers diagram; sometimes it is called a <dfn class="terminology">Young diagram</dfn>. At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.</p>
