<body><div class="solution"><p>If we line up \(k\) identical books, there are \(k-1\) places in between two books. If we choose \(n-1\) of these places and slip dividers into those places, then we have a first clump of books, a second clump of books, and so on. The \(i\)th element of our list is the number of books in the \(i\)th clump. Clearly using books is irrelevant; we could line up any \(k\) identical objects and make the same argument. Our bijection is between compositions and \((n-1)\)-element subsets of the set of \(k-1\) spaces between our objects.</p></div></body>
