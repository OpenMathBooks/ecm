<p>The counting problems in <a data-knowl="./knowl/act-lowerpaths.html" title="Activity 109">Activities 109–114</a> are not supposed to be easy to solve, but you have a lot of combinatorial tools to try.  Say as much as you can about as many as you can before moving on.  At the very least, you should answer the counting problems for small values of \(n\) by writing out the set of outcomes.  In <a href="sec_basic-catalan.html#subsec-catalanseq" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.5.2: The Catalan Numbers">Subsection 1.5.2</a>, we will investigate the problems in more depth and see how to answer them fully.</p>
