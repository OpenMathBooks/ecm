<p>To use the quotient principle, treat the exclamation marks as distinct, and arrange all 12 magnets in \(12!\) ways.  Then group lines if the exclamation marks are in the same positions.  There are \(5!\) lines in each group, so there are \(12!/5!\) groups.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can see this is correct by thinking about picking one of the 12 positions to put the A into, then one of the remaining positions for the B, and so on.  This is \(P(12,7)\text{,}\) just to put the letters down.  But now you have only one choice as to where to put the exclamation marks.</p>
