<p> Suppose you have a bipartite graph \(G\text{.}\) This will consist of two sets of vertices \(A\) and \(B\) with some edges connecting some vertices of \(A\) to some vertices in \(B\) (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in \(A\) or both in \(B\)). A <dfn class="terminology">matching</dfn> of \(G\) is a set of <dfn class="terminology">independent edges</dfn>, meaning no two edges in the set are adjacent.  If every vertex in \(G\) is incident to exactly one edge in the matching, we call the matching <dfn class="terminology">perfect</dfn>. If a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, then \(\card{A} = \card{B}\text{,}\) but in general, we could have a <dfn class="terminology">matching of \(A\)</dfn>, which will mean that every vertex in \(A\) is incident to an edge in the matching.</p>
