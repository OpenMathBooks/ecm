<body><div class="solution"><p>This is similar to <a data-knowl="./knowl/exc-seq-lessthan-100.html" title="Exercise B.6.5.15">ExerciseÂ B.6.5.15</a>, although there you were showing that a sequence had all its terms less than some value, and here you are showing that the sum is less than som value.
