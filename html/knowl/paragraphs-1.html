<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">How to use this book.</span></h5>
<p>This book is mostly about solving problems, and using those problems and their solutions to develop mathematics and mathematical understanding.  The main three chapters consist of more than 300 <em class="emphasis">activities</em> and <em class="emphasis">exercises</em> which the reader is asked to complete.  That is how you should use the book.  As you read, when you come to an activity, really take some time to try to solve it.  Many of the activities are broken down into tasks to help guide you to a solution.  If you get stuck, check for a hint.  In the pdf, problems with hints are marked with a small “[hint]” link that will take you to the hint in the back of the book; clicking on the number of the hint will return you to the activity.  The online version has expandable hint links under any activities for which they are provided.</p>
<p>The exercises are similar to activities, but can be thought of as optional.  In particular, it is less important that you complete the exercise immediately, as they are not used to motivate the next part of the text.  Some of the exercises allow you to deepen your understanding of a topic; others are just for practice.</p>
<p>Solutions are not provided explicitly, but often the important content of an activity will be explained further into the book.  We have made every effort to make the problems “self checking” so that you do not run the risk of learning something false.</p>
<p>For the most part, if you are unable to complete an activity, assuming you have put a reasonable effort in already, it would be safe to move on.  If the activity is meant to guide you to a fundamental concept, that will become apparent, and later activities and exposition will help you uncover that concept.  Other activities are meant to provide interesting examples of these big ideas, but missing any one of them will not impede your progress on other activities.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface.html#paragraphs-1">in-context</a></span>
