<p>First we describe a transformation on Young diagrams. Here is the first part of the description. Suppose the smallest part \(m\) of \(\lambda\) is less than or equal to the number \(j\) of rows in the top trapezoid. Suppose further that if we have only one trapezoid, then \(j&gt;m\text{.}\) Then we construct a partition with one less part by adding 1 to each of the \(m\) largest parts and discarding the part \(m\text{.}\) We still have a diagram for a partition of the same integer, but now the parity of the number of parts has changed, and we <em class="emphasis">may</em> have increased the number of trapezoids by 1. The smallest part will now be larger than the number (now \(m\)) of rows in the top trapezoid. (Notice that the construction would not work if we had only one trapezoid and \(j=m\) because we would first remove one row of the trapezoid and thus have no row to which to attach one of our squares.)</p>
