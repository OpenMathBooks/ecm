<div class="introduction"><p>A group of \(n\) students goes to a restaurant carrying backpacks. The manager invites everyone to check their backpack at the check desk and everyone does. While they are eating, a child playing in the check room randomly moves around the claim check stubs on the backpacks. We will try to compute the probability that, at the end of the meal, at least one student receives his or her own backpack.  This probability is the fraction of the total number of ways to return the backpacks in which at least one student gets his or her own backpack back.</p></div>
